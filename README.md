Chronic Kidney Disorder Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using various machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a user-friendly Streamlit web app for real-time predictions. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and healthcare analytics.

Features
Machine Learning Models: Includes logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling missing values.
Model Training & Evaluation: Training with cross-validation and performance metrics.
Streamlit App: Interactive web application for user input and real-time predictions.
Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/chronic-kidney-disease-prediction.git
cd chronic-kidney-disease-prediction
Install Required Libraries:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit App:


streamlit run app.py
Dataset
The project uses a public dataset containing patient information with features relevant for CKD prediction. You can find the dataset here (if applicable).

Usage
Enter patient data in the provided input fields in the Streamlit app.
Click the "Predict" button to receive a risk assessment for CKD.
The app displays results and model insights for further understanding.
